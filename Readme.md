# Programming task

The task should be solved using .Net Core and ASP.Net Core with C# as the programming
language. The solution should be returned with complete source code. 

# Task
Create a simple application which can be used for calculating the cost of a housing loan. 

## Description
* The application should have a simple user interface where the user can specify the desired amount and the payback time in years. 
* For simplicity we assume a fixed interest of 3.5% per year during the complete payback time. 
    * The interest should be connected to the loan type in such a manner that different loan types can have different interests. 
* When selecting the amount and payback time, the application should generate a monthly payback plan based on the series loan principle, i.e. you pay back an equal amount each month and add the generated interest. 
* The interest is calculated every month.
* The application should be made in such a manner that it can easily be extended to calculate apayment plan for other types of loans, for instance car loan, spending loan etc. with different interests. 
* Also bear in mind that it should be easy to extend the application to cover other payback schemes as well. We do not expect this to be implemented.

We expect that you demonstrate reasonable use of the available language functionality for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, a good class structure and show a good programming practice. 

We are focused on code quality and good design.
